#jQuery Plugins!
###Visit: [jQuery_plugins](www.saikandala.com/jQuery_plugins)


##Summary:
This is a collection of useful jQuery plugins that would give HTML elements more pizazz! These are made purely with Javascript/jQuery, HTML, and CSS.

These plugins are made to implement the practice of Object Oriented Programming. The user can pass in an HTML element into each jQuery plugin which will give that element access to the plugins effects and functions.

The goal is to have plugins that are easy to use and robust.

##About the plugins:
- **Tabs**: Allows for the user to fade information in and out from a list of items, allowing for a clean, presentable look.
- **Side-Scroll**: Given a list of pictures, Side-Scroll takes those and allows the user to cycle through each picture.
- **Zoom**: Implements a magnifying glass over a given picture, allowing the user to see the finer details.
